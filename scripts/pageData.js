And there I was, unarmed, and, with the exception of a loin cloth, as naked as I had come into the world.  I could imagine how my first ancestor felt that distant, prehistoric morn that he encountered for the first time the terrifying progenitor of the thing that had me cornered now beside the restless, mysterious sea."
